<h1>About Ben</h1>

<h2>I'm a student in computer science.</h2>
<p>I find great pleasure in learning more about the various things I enjoy, such as working on my car or playing around on my computer. Even if I don't know exactly what I'm doing, I love to try and figure things out.</p>

<p>You can see more about my <a href="experience.html">work experience,</a> or <a href="projects.html">projects</a> that I've worked on, or <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me directly.</p>
