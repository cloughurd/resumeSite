<h1>About Ben</h1>

<h2>I'm a student in computer science.</h2>
<p>I find great pleasure in learning more about the various things I enjoy, such as working on my car or playing around on my computer. Even if I don't know exactly what I'm doing, I love to try and figure things out.</p>
<p>There are a few cool projects I have been able to accomplish during my studies of computer science:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I created a simple quiz game to test you on the 50 US state capitals;</li>
	<li>I created and developed the functionality of a replicate cache memory system;</li>
	<li>I made a program that performs grayscaling, inverting, and embossing effects on digital photos.</li>
</ul>
<p>I currently work as a computer repair technician at the BYU store. I have previously worked as an assistant IT tech. In high school, I made sandwiches and managed the cash register at a Firehouse Subs franchise location.</p>
